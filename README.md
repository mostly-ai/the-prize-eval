## Stage 1

During stage 1 anyone with a GitHub account was invited to participate. All submissions were automatically evaluated via the [Synthetic Data Quality Assurance](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostlyai-qa) toolkit. All results can be found here: [stage1-results.csv](./stage1-results.csv).

## Stage 2

During stage 2 the top 5 leaders of stage 1 were invited to submit their code submissions, which were then evaluated on a slightly modified version of the stage 1 datasets.

With the support of a fantastic jury board of renowned synthetic data experts (@suhaskowshik @adivekar-utexas @shree-gade @mplatzer @scriminaci @psitronic), these code submissions were then run on dedicated GPU instances a total of 6 times each. The generated synthetic data was captured, and then again evaluated with the same metrics as for Stage 1.
