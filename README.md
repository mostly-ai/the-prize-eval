A BIG thank you to all participants for pushing the boundaries of synthetic data further, and acchieving new **state-of-the-art accuracy** for large scale synthetic datasets with open-source solutions! ‚≠ê 

And a HUGE congratulations to [Gandagorn](https://github.com/Gandagorn) ü•á for winning the total prize of $100,000! üéâ

## Stage 1

During stage 1 anyone with a GitHub account was invited to participate. All submissions were automatically evaluated via the [Synthetic Data Quality Assurance](https://github.com/mostly-ai/mostlyai-qa) toolkit. All results can be found here: [stage1-results.csv](./stage1-results.csv).

## Stage 2

During stage 2 the top 5 leaders of stage 1 were invited to submit their code submissions, which were then evaluated on a slightly modified version of the stage 1 datasets. With the support of a fantastic jury board of renowned synthetic data experts ([@suhaskowshik](https://github.com/suhaskowshik), [@adivekar-utexas](https://github.com/adivekar-utexas), [@shree-gade](https://github.com/shree-gade), [@mplatzer](https://github.com/mplatzer), [@scriminaci](https://github.com/scriminaci), [@psitronic](https://github.com/psitronic)), these code submissions were then run on dedicated GPU instances a total of 6 times each. The generated synthetic data was captured, and then again evaluated with the same metrics as for Stage 1. All results can be found here: [stage2-results.csv](./stage2-results.csv).
